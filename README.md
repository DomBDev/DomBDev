Here you'll find part of my journey as a programmer and student. I believe in constantly educating myself, connecting with new people, and pushing the boundaries of what I can do in the world of programming.

## About Me

I'm Dominic, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills as a programmer. While my main focus lies in web development, I am also intrigued by machine learning, data science, and various other fields. I strive to make every project I work on a testament to my progress.

## Technologies

I'm well-versed in a wide range of technologies. You'll often find me utilizing Python, Flask, JavaScript, Node.js, React, HTML, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, CSS, Nginx, SQL, and some C++ in my projects. Each of these tools enables me to create new solutions to solve any problems that I may find.

- Beyond this, most of what I've learned has been self taught, which is why I have become resourceful in learning any information that could progress me towards my goals. I've maintained private servers, utilized various languages and libraries, and hosted websites with various tools such as Nginx, Cloudflare Security, DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, and Heroku.
